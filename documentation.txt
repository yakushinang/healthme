TASK NOTIFICATIONS
1. tabe_data : The assignment didnt mention from where table data comes. I assumed for now to save it as a global variable list.

2. The table layout: There are many ways that the table can be implemented ( <table> , css grid, flexbox...) for this specific table I choose flexbox, because there were no requerment for the table to be contend sized.
